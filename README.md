Hi & Welcome to my Profile!
===========================

I'm a Reaseach and Development Scientist working for Direct Electron.  My background is in tecnique development for 4D STEM (and 5D STEM!).  I 
currently spend most of my open source development time working on HyperSpy, pyxem and affiliated projects.

I'm particually interested in:
------------------------------

- Processing big microscope datasets quickly using distributed and out of memory processing
- Characterizing complex glassy materials
- Open source projects for data visualization and processing

Examples of my Previous work:
-----------------------------

If you are interested in my previous work, my contributions to pyxem and HyperSpy provide good examples.  Most of the 
work there is related to lazy, out of memory integrations with dask, data visualization and increasing file i-o performance. 

Please contact me if you are interested in how to integrate Direct Electron Cameras into open source projects.
