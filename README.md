Hi & Welcome to my Profile!
===========================

I'm a PhD candidate working at the University of Wisconsin Madison on method and tecnique development for 4D STEM.  I 
currently spend most of my development time working on the open source projects HyperSpy, pyxem and affiliated projects.

I'm particually interested in:
------------------------------

- Processing big microscope datasets quickly using distributed and out of memory processing
- Characterizing complex glassy materials
- Open source projects for data visualization and processing

Examples of my Previous work:
-----------------------------

If you are interested in my previous work, my contributions to pyxem and HyperSpy provide good examples.  Most of the 
work there is related to lazy, out of memory integrations with dask, data visualization and increasing file i-o performance.
